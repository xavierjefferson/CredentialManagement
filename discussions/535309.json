Just trying in a developer machine, the OS is windows 7 and later on i want to host in a Server OS.<br />\n<br />\nThe Credential class object creation and other properties code is as below.<br />\n<pre><code>  Credential cred = new Credential(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;some-target&quot;, CredentialType.Generic);\n\n            if (cred.Load() == false)\n            {\n                cred.Username = userName;\n                cred.Password = passWord;\n                cred.PersistanceType = PersistanceType.Session;\n                cred.Type = CredentialType.Generic;\n                cred.Target = &quot;some-target&quot;;\n                cred.Save();\n            }</code></pre>\n\nIn this code, the the save call succeeding, but i could not see any change in the windows vault/credential manager of control panel. When i read the credentials with the same target name, it is returning the previously stored credentials.<br />\nSo, i understood that it is storing the credentials in somewhere other than windows Vault.<br />\n-Is my understanding of storing the credentials in credential manager available in control panel is wrong ? <br />\n-Or is it storing the credential somewhere else than the local credential manager?<br />\n-Really is it storing somewhere in the machine ? <br />\nPlease provide me some some information to solve this issue.<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance.<br />\n<br />\n-Kiran<br />\n",
